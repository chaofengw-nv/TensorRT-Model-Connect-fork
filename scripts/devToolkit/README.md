# TRTMC DevToolkit

`scripts/devToolkit` is a repository-local Python toolkit for composing TRTMC
development environments and commands. It is not a workflow engine: Python is
the composition language, and each operation can be called independently.

The environment core has four stages:

```text
EnvironmentRequest -> resolve() -> EnvironmentLock
EnvironmentLock    -> provision() -> ProvisionedEnvironment
ProvisionedEnvironment + BuildRecipe -> build() -> BuildResult
ProvisionedEnvironment + CommandSpec -> run() -> CommandResult
```

Attestation and receipts are automatic postconditions of these operations.
There is no version allowlist or preset admission check in this path.

Execution-resource lifecycle is an independent, optional capability. It feeds a
ready target into the same environment API instead of introducing a workflow:

```text
DockerTarget -> targets.resolve()   -> TargetPlan
TargetPlan   -> targets.provision() -> ProvisionedTarget.execution_target
```

## Resolve and use the target's existing toolchain

The TensorRT request accepts any exact four-part version. When CUDA is omitted,
resolution first looks for a complete target CUDA toolkit: `nvcc`, headers,
`libcudart`, `libcublas`, and `libcurand` must all be present. If no complete
target CUDA is available, the policy falls back to managed CUDA 13.3.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys

repo = Path.cwd()
sys.path.insert(0, str(repo / "scripts" / "devToolkit"))

from trtmc_devtoolkit import (
    DevToolkit,
    EnvironmentRequest,
    ExecutionTarget,
    TrtmcBuildRecipe,
)

toolkit = DevToolkit.from_checkout(repo)
lock = toolkit.resolve(
    EnvironmentRequest(
        tensorrt="11.2.0.113",
        target=ExecutionTarget.local(python="python3.12", gpu="0"),
    )
)
environment = toolkit.provision(lock)
build = toolkit.build(
    environment,
    TrtmcBuildRecipe(
        targets=("trtmc", "trtmc_backend_trt", "trtmc_model_qwen"),
        outputs={"trtmc": "trtmc"},
    ),
)

toolkit.run_trtmc(environment, ("version",), build=build)
```

`build()` itself only snapshots source, serializes identical builds, runs the
selected recipe, hashes outputs, and writes evidence. `TrtmcBuildRecipe` is an
optional sample recipe that configures CMake against the resolved TensorRT
runtime and builds only the requested targets. It does not install the checkout
into or otherwise mutate the locked toolchain Python environment. User recipes
can replace it completely. The sample recipe queries GPU compute capability
through the CUDA Driver API (with `nvidia-smi` as a fallback), and automatically
selects Ninja when available or Unix Makefiles otherwise. Both can be overridden
explicitly.

For a user-owned unified CUDA/TensorRT installation, pass
the prefix as toolchain-owned configuration. Resolution checks the prefix
rather than ambient host locations:

```python
request = EnvironmentRequest(
    tensorrt="11.2.0.113",
    target=ExecutionTarget.local(),
    toolchain="prefix",
    toolchain_options={"prefix": "/path/to/toolchain"},
)
```

To combine managed TensorRT artifacts with a caller-owned CUDA prefix, use
`toolchain_options={"cuda_prefix": "/path/to/cuda"}`. Execution target options
never carry toolchain configuration.

## Create, start, or adopt a Docker target

The target API owns Docker image and container lifecycle. The separate Docker
execution-context provider consumes the resulting running container; it does
not hide container creation inside environment resolution. The caller chooses
the image, GPUs, mounts, workspace, state location, command, IPC mode, and
environment instead of inheriting an NGC- or campaign-specific convention.

This example pulls an image when absent, creates and starts the container, then
passes its immutable container identity into arbitrary-version environment
resolution:

```python
from pathlib import PurePosixPath

from trtmc_devtoolkit import (
    DockerGpuRequest,
    DockerImageRef,
    DockerMount,
    DockerTarget,
    DockerTargetPolicy,
)

docker = toolkit.targets.ensure(
    DockerTarget(
        name="trtmc-dev",
        image=DockerImageRef("registry.example/cuda:13.3-devel"),
        gpus=DockerGpuRequest.devices("1"),
        mounts=(
            DockerMount(repo.resolve(), PurePosixPath("/workspace/trtmc")),
        ),
        workspace=PurePosixPath("/workspace/trtmc"),
        state=PurePosixPath("/state/devtoolkit"),
        ipc="host",
    ),
    policy=DockerTargetPolicy.ENSURE,
)

lock = toolkit.resolve(
    EnvironmentRequest(
        tensorrt="11.2.0.113",
        target=docker.execution_target,
    )
)
environment = toolkit.provision(lock)
```

`DockerImageBuild(context=Path("image"))` can replace `DockerImageRef` when the
image itself should be built from a caller-owned Dockerfile. Build arguments are
read from the subprocess environment, so their values do not appear in command
logs or receipts.

Target policies are explicit:

`DockerTargetPolicy` belongs to the Docker adapter. The provider-neutral target
service forwards each adapter's policy object without interpreting it, so a
remote-machine or Kubernetes provider can define its own lifecycle semantics.

- `ADOPT` requires an already-running matching container and performs no image
  or container mutation.
- `START` may start an existing matching container, but never pulls, builds, or
  creates.
- `ENSURE` may pull/build the image and create/start the container as needed.
- `CREATE` creates a missing container and accepts only an idempotent retry of a
  container owned by the same target plan.

No policy deletes or silently replaces an existing container. A name collision
or configuration drift fails with the mismatched fields so ownership remains
with the caller. Matching compares the complete effective environment and mount
set: image-declared environment defaults and volumes are accepted, request
values may override them, and undeclared additions fail closed.

After the target is ready, the execution-context provider records its Docker
daemon ID, immutable container ID, and image ID, and probes its actual Python,
CUDA, TensorRT Python package, native library, and headers before producing the
environment lock.
Docker CLI 20.10 or newer is required so command environment values can use
`docker exec --env-file` without appearing in process arguments.
The lock binds the Docker daemon ID, immutable container ID, and image ID. The
binding is rechecked before provisioning, attestation, builds, and commands, so
a recycled container name or changed Docker context fails closed.

An already-running user container can still be passed directly when lifecycle
management is not wanted:

```python
lock = toolkit.resolve(
    EnvironmentRequest(
        tensorrt="11.0.2.2",
        architecture="aarch64",
        target=ExecutionTarget.docker(
            container="jedha-campaign",
            docker_context="default",  # Omit to capture `docker context show`.
            workspace="/workspace/TensorRT-Model-Connect",
        ),
    )
)
environment = toolkit.provision(lock)

toolkit.run_trtmc(
    environment,
    ["build", "qwen3-0.6b", "--precision", "fp8", "--output", "/tmp/q.bundle"],
)
```

The CLI arguments are opaque to DevToolkit. Model-specific flags, validation,
and performance policy stay with the model family or caller recipe.
Command environment values are passed through a short-lived mode-0600 Docker
env file and removed after execution; they are never placed in Docker argv.

## Managed fallback and arbitrary TensorRT

Arbitrary-version support is accept, resolve, install, and attest. Resolution
first tries the target's installed toolchains. If none matches, the built-in
NVIDIA catalog resolves an exact public TensorRT distribution (Python package,
bindings, native libraries, and development headers) to immutable SHA-256
artifacts. With no complete target CUDA, it also resolves the CUDA 13.3 native
build component closure from NVIDIA's redistribution manifest. Provisioning
downloads those pins into a content-addressed cache and installs them under the
environment's isolated state prefix; it does not modify the target's system
Python or `/usr/local/cuda`. The public lock also pins `pip`, `setuptools`, and
`wheel`, so a minimal target whose Python lacks `ensurepip` can bootstrap its
isolated virtual environment without an OS-package install.

Versions unavailable from the public indexes, such as an internal or pre-release
build, can be supplied through a team JSON catalog. This is still automatic
installation—the manifest is discovery metadata, not a version allowlist:

```python
from trtmc_devtoolkit import DevToolkit, JsonToolchainCatalog, builtin_provider_registry

registry = builtin_provider_registry()
registry.register_catalog(JsonToolchainCatalog((repo / "private-toolchains.json",)))
toolkit = DevToolkit.from_checkout(repo, providers=registry.freeze())

lock = toolkit.resolve(
    EnvironmentRequest(
        tensorrt="11.2.0.113",
        target=ExecutionTarget.local(),
        toolchain_options={"catalog": "json-toolchain-catalog"},
    )
)
```

The corresponding manifest binds the private artifacts by digest and can reuse
the target's complete CUDA toolkit by major version:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "toolchains": [
    {
      "id": "gb300-trt-11.2.0.113",
      "tensorrt": "11.2.0.113",
      "python": "3.12",
      "architecture": "x86_64",
      "cuda": {"source": "target", "major": "13"},
      "artifacts": [
        {"name": "tensorrt-bindings", "uri": "https://artifact.example/bindings.whl", "sha256": "<64 lowercase hex>"},
        {"name": "tensorrt-libs", "uri": "https://artifact.example/libs.whl", "sha256": "<64 lowercase hex>"},
        {"name": "tensorrt-headers", "uri": "https://artifact.example/headers.deb", "sha256": "<64 lowercase hex>"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For an entirely managed CUDA, use `{"source": "managed", "version":
"13.3", "release": "13.3.0", "artifacts": [...]}` and list the named CUDA
component artifacts in the record's common `artifacts` array. A private source
distribution targeting a minimal Python can likewise list digest-pinned
bootstrap wheels in the common array and reference their names through
`python_bootstrap_artifacts`. Relative artifact paths are resolved relative to
the manifest and must be reachable from the execution target. Artifact URI
userinfo cannot contain credentials. Use
pre-authorized URLs, target-visible local paths, or a custom catalog and
materializer when the artifact store requires another transport or
authentication scheme.

If neither a public nor an explicitly registered catalog can supply the exact
version, resolution raises `ArtifactUnavailable`; it never substitutes a nearby
version. Use `CudaPolicy.exact("12.8")`, `CudaPolicy.system_only()`, or
`CudaPolicy.managed("13.3")` to override the default policy.

## Qualification is explicit and source-neutral

DevToolkit has no built-in qualification dataset and loads no qualification
records by default. A caller may attach optional qualification evidence through
a source adapter; this never controls which TensorRT version can be attempted.

```python
from trtmc_devtoolkit import JsonQualificationSource

toolkit = DevToolkit.from_checkout(
    repo,
    qualifications=(JsonQualificationSource((Path("my-qualifications"),)),),
)

# Optional provenance, fail closed only because the caller explicitly asks.
request = EnvironmentRequest(
    tensorrt="11.2.1.2",
    target=ExecutionTarget.local(),
    preset="team-qualified-trt112",
    require_qualification=True,
)
```

A JSON qualification record declares generic, source-neutral facts rather than
a repository-specific environment bundle:

```json
{
  "id": "team-qualified-trt112",
  "status": "qualified",
  "requirements": {
    "tensorrt": "11.2.1.2",
    "cuda": ["13.3"],
    "architecture": ["x86_64"],
    "execution": ["local", "container"]
  }
}
```

The record's content digest is stored as provenance but does not alter the
identity of an otherwise identical environment.
Malformed qualification metadata is ignored for unrestricted resolution; it
fails closed when the caller requests a preset or requires qualification.

## Identity and evidence

| Identity | Includes | Excludes |
|---|---|---|
| Target plan | Docker daemon, image source/build input digest, container configuration, hashed environment values | live container/image IDs, secret values |
| Provisioned target | Docker daemon ID, immutable container and image IDs, observed configuration digest | mutable container name as identity |
| Environment lock | resolved context, effective path mapping, exact Python/CUDA/TRT, provider versions, artifact digests | source revision, GPU SM, preset spelling, private locator |
| Provisioned environment | lock ID, effective execution identity, normalized toolchain runtime, observed file digests | command occurrence |
| Build request | environment ID, source snapshot, SM set, CMake/build inputs | command occurrence |
| Build result | build request ID and output digests | unrelated later runs |
| Command invocation | environment ID, arguments, path scopes, environment-value digest, build/artifact provenance | occurrence ID |

Target provisioning writes `target-plan.json` and `provision-receipt.json`
under `.devtoolkit/targets/<plan-id>/`. Environment provisioning writes
`environment-lock.json`, `provision-receipt.json`, and an
observed attestation under `.devtoolkit/environments/<lock-id>/`. Builds and
commands write their own v3 receipts below that environment directory. Receipts
do not serialize provider secrets or environment variable values. JSON receipts
are replaced atomically, and provisioning for one environment ID is serialized
across processes to avoid partial or competing terminal state. Identical build
requests are also serialized across processes. A completed managed prefix is
reused after fresh attestation, and a completed build is reused only after its
receipt identity and output digests are revalidated.
Build failures before a build request ID can be computed are recorded below
`builds/preflight/` with the environment ID and failed stage.

## Extension points

There are four provider protocols:

- `ToolchainSource`: discover, materialize, and observe a CUDA/TensorRT toolchain.
- `ToolchainCatalog`: turn version intent into immutable artifacts for a
  registered materializer.
- `TargetProvider`: resolve, provision, and attest an execution resource.
- `ExecutionContext`: bind a ready execution identity and execute mapped commands.

Extension contracts live under `trtmc_devtoolkit.spi`. Execution contexts
declare semantic capabilities such as `host-filesystem` or
`container-process`; toolchain adapters select capabilities rather than
provider names. Register adapters explicitly; there is no implicit entry-point
discovery or workflow DAG.

```python
from trtmc_devtoolkit import builtin_provider_registry

registry = builtin_provider_registry()
registry.register_target(MyRemoteTargetProvider())
registry.register_context(MyRemoteContext())
registry.register_toolchain(MyTensorRTSource())
toolkit = DevToolkit.from_checkout(repo, providers=registry.freeze())
```

## API scope

DevToolkit exposes independent target lifecycle through `targets`, plus
environment capabilities `resolve()`, `provision()`, `build()`, `run()`, and
`run_trtmc()`. Higher-level development flows belong in user code or examples
composed from those capabilities; DevToolkit does not define a workflow DAG or
gate environment preparation on qualification presets.
