"""Per-family engine tests for Phi-MoE (Mixture of Experts with SparseMixer).

Intention:
    Validate the Phi-MoE family plugin end-to-end: weight loading from
    synthetic HF safetensors, weight key mapping, shape correctness, and
    (with TRT+GPU) engine build and IO tensor naming.

    Phi-MoE uses the standard decoder attention (RoPE + GQA) but replaces the
    SwiGLU MLP with a router + N expert MLPs. The router uses SparseMixer
    (not standard top-k softmax) to select top-2 experts per token. Each
    expert's weight is computed from an independent masked softmax over all
    logits, so the weights do NOT sum to 1.0.

    Key differences from standard Phi-3:
      - LayerNorm (with bias) instead of RMSNorm
      - Separate Q/K/V/O projections (not fused) with biases
      - MoE block: router + N experts, each a SwiGLU MLP
      - lm_head has bias

Setup:
    Uses FamilyPluginTester + FamilyPluginTestMixin infrastructure. Overrides
    get_config_dict() (to add num_local_experts, num_experts_per_tok, and
    LayerNorm biases), make_hf_tensors() (for MoE weight layout with router +
    per-expert MLPs + biases on everything), and expected_weight_keys() (for
    router + expert.{e}.w_gate/up/down + bias keys + lm_head_bias).
    Uses a tiny model with 2 experts to keep engine build fast.
    Tier 2 is skipped because Phi-MoE uses a custom MoE decoder builder with
    SparseMixer routing rather than the standard single-engine builder.

Trace: ARCH-FAM-001, UD-FAM-PHIMOE-01
Intent: Validate the Phi-MoE family plugin weight loading including SparseMixer router, per-expert SwiGLU MLP mapping, LayerNorm biases, QKV biases, and lm_head bias.
Preconditions: safetensors and tensorrt_model_connect are importable; TRT+GPU required for engine build tests.
Postconditions: Router and per-expert weight keys are present with biases, LayerNorm biases are loaded, and MoE-specific config fields are parsed correctly.
